# Perform Experiments Workshop

## Summary

This workshop involves developing a Java program to perform experiments on motif finding with different parameters and save the results in a CSV file.

### Development Summary

1. **Generate Sequences**: Generate random DNA sequences based on given probabilities and lengths.
2. **Find Motifs**: Identify the most frequent motifs of given lengths in the sequences.
3. **Measure Performance**: Measure the time taken to find motifs and count their occurrences.
4. **Save Results**: Save the experiment results, including parameters and performance metrics, to a CSV file.

## Contents

- **Code**: The Java source code for the Perform Experiments program.
