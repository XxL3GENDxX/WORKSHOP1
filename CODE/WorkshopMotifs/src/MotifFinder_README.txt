# Motif Finder Workshop

## Summary

This workshop involves developing a Java program to find motifs in DNA sequences and calculate the sequence with the highest entropy.

### Development Summary

1. **Generate Sequences**: Generate random DNA sequences based on given probabilities.
2. **Save Sequences**: Save the generated sequences to a text file.
3. **Find Motifs**: Identify the most frequent motifs of a given length in the sequences.
4. **Calculate Entropy**: Calculate the entropy of each sequence and identify the sequence with the highest entropy.

## Contents

- **Code**: The Java source code for the Motif Finder program.
